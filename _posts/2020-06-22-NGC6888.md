# NGC6888 with multiple conditions and the enhancement of Optolong L-eNhance filter

decided to spend a few nights on the same object -- 3 infact and took a series of images with the same length of exposure and with and without the L-enhance filter!

so the first image this is 20 x 10 mins with no filter 
![image][nofilter]

this is the same integration with the fileter in place 
![image][filter]

and finally this is going nuts and undertaking 10 x 20 mins exposure with the filter
![image][longfilter]

I think its worth while having the filter
