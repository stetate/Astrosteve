### Astronomy Confession
My name is Stephen Tate and this is my confession about this hobby:

- I spend too much time in dark fields with just myself and wild animals
- work is always secondary to the hobby (which i guess is a good thing)
- I would spend all of my time and money enjoying the night sky 
- Work is secondary to spending an all night session with the stars 


### My History in Astronomy
Started to become interested in the the visual observing in the late 1997 whilst living in the UK. The local Astronomy club at the time was a great source of information and I had an absolute blast! Soon after joining though I moved to Macclesfield where the local society is significantly larger and meets at Jodrell Bank and it took some time to identify willing people to enjoy the sky with.

Similar time i acquired my first real telescope a 10" Orion optics newtonian
