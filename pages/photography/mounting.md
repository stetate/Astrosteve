Cameras as has been discussed have advanced to allow long exposures. This enables almost any camera to be used for night sky photography! The main
challenge is holding the camera steady why you take a long exposure. This may sound easy but the camera is only detecting a single star on a single pixel and if you shake 
then the image will start to blur

The aim is to hold the camera steady and this is where the use of a tripod is necessary.

##The desperate mount....

Ok so before we hit the camera tripods what if you dont have one ! we dont dispare it is possible, not easy to ensure that you can take night time photos withoutha tripod.
First we have to ensure that we have a stable and semi flat surface (a car roof is good for this). Next we need to be able to ensure that the camera does not slip, and then we need to find something to raise the lens up 
and point in the direction you want! I have used a wallet, a piel of journals i had in the car, a bok amd finally an old Timmies cup which i have cut and squashed to a shapen needed.
Sound easy -- this is realy a last resort setup as this is not really stable nor is it very easy -- yes I have dont this!

If this is all you have do not truely despare as it is possibel you will just have a much harder time
