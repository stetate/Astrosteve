# Sadr region with REDCAT and full moon using 6D and Optolong L-eNhance filter

Was wondering what woudl happen with the L-eNhance and the full moon. Strict 3-7nm Ha filters are very good under a full 
moon so there is no reason why the dual band filter should not work. However the intial processing of the images always looks very blue this is due to the OIII line emmision in the atmosphere caused by the full moon. 

So the Image of the Sadr region was down with 27 x 3 min exposures. Processing in pix insight by combining the darks and generating a bad pixel map then applying this to the light frames. 
The light frames were registered and integrated and from there histgram and 
![image][filter]

this is the same integration with the filter in place 
![image][longfilter]


I think its worth while having the filter
