# about North american and pelican Nebulae
On October 24, 1786, William Herschel observing from Slough, England, noted a “faint milky nebulosity scattered over this space, in some places pretty bright.” 
The most prominent region was catalogued by his son John Herschel on August 21, 1829. It was listed in the New General Catalogue as NGC 7000, where it is described as a "faint, most extremely large, diffuse nebulosity.”
In 1890, the pioneering German astrophotographer Max Wolf noticed this nebula’s characteristic shape on a long-exposure photograph, and dubbed it the North America Nebula.

The Pelican is much studied because it has a particularly active mix of star formation and evolving gas clouds. The light from young energetic stars is slowly transforming cold gas to hot and causing an ionization front gradually to advance outward. Particularly dense filaments of cold gas are seen to still remain, and among these are found two jets emitted from the Herbig–Haro object 555.[1] Millions of years from now this nebula might no longer be known as the Pelican, as the balance and placement of stars and gas will leave something that appears completely different.
The Pelican Nebula (also known as IC 5070 and IC 5067) is an H II region associated with the North America Nebula in the constellation Cygnus. The gaseous contortions of this emission nebula bear a resemblance to a pelican, giving rise to its name. 
The Pelican Nebula is located nearby first magnitude star Deneb, and is divided from its more prominent neighbour, the North America Nebula, by a molecular cloud filled with dark dust.

# NGC7000 is one of the largest regions of nebulae in the sky
NGC 7000 and IC5070 are generally imaged together and this is one instance that the RedCat really does excel

![image][im1]

The image above is the latest image taken of the North American nebulae. This is a composite immage of 45 x 2 min images taken with the RedCat and 6D the image has been processed in Pixinsight.
This object has been images a number of time and one image which i am perticularly happy with was the Ultra-wide field

![image][im4]
this image was taken with a 50 mm Sigma lense and there does not benefit from the presence of the L-Enhance filter.

If anybody needs convincing of the need for this filter on this type of object then the following images will show the real value and almost abosulte need.

a composite image of NGC7000 region with redcat and 6D without the filter in place and finally the same image integration, iso and all other settings but with the filter
