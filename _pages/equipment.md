# The Equipment used to Generate these images

The Equipment which I use as a day to day workhorses include my ageing William Optics FLT110 and now my William Optics RedCat51

##_WO FLT110 Original Optics._
This really is my workhorse -- this is a critical piece of equipment and was an amazing pourchase. As with many scopes i have had issues with the focuser and still do -- it really was teh worse part of this telescope but the Optics......

It really does have good optics held in a sturdy cell which has been mistreated and bounced around. All of the telescopic images are taken with the FLT it is the only scope worth imaging through.
