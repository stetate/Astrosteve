# Orion and Horse Head
![image][veil]

The image is 22 x 5 min images stacked and processed with PixInsight taken at ISO 4000 with 6D and RedCat.
The images shows the Flaming Star nebulae (IC405), IC410 and IC417. On the very bottom of the image is M38. The other object is the green streak of Comet C/2020 M3(Atlas) which is just below the Flaming Star Neb. and then Comet C/2015 T5 (Cheppard-Tholen) which is seen in the top right (again a small green smidge!)
