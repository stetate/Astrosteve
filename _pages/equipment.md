# The Equipment used to Generate these images

I have 4 Telescopes which are functional. a WO RedCat51, Skywatcher 102 Achromat, Orion ED80 and a WO FLT TMB 110. I also have an UK Orion 10" newtonian but this needs a lot of love and attention 

The telescoeps are mounted on in general a Losmandy G11 with Gemini control and the smaller redcat is on a iOptron EQ30Pro

I use both a Cannon 6D and a sBIG ST8300 camera for imaging as well as having a number of really nice camera full frame lenses
