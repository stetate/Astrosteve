My name is Stephen tate and this is my confession about this hobby:

- I spend too much time in dark fields with just myself and wild animals
- work is always secondary to the hobby (which i guess is a good thing)
- I would spend all of my time and money enjoying the night sky 
- a nocturnal life spounds better thn current
