# Cameras for Night Sky Photography

These days there is no limit to the type of camera which can be used. 
Long gone are the days of SLR with slide film using specialist film treated in ways to increase sensitivity of the film 
and thankfully is do not miss those days, sliced slides as “they are blank with just Nosie of them” or sorry it 
looks like there is something wrong with your camera”. 
<br/>
The rise of modern DSLR, point and shoot or even smart phones have revolutionised what people are able to photograph. 
Most full functional cameras come with a full manual mode which is likely the one mode that is in all honesty never used. 
Most also come with a Bulb mode this is the preferred mode it offers the full camera functionality as well as offering 
long exposure. When using bulb mode an item of extra hardware is required this is called an intervalvometer and it 
will operate the camera shutter allowing exposures which are longer than those available within the camera software and 
also mean you don’t have to touch the camera to start the exposure. 
<br/>
##Latest generation Smart Phones
In all honesty I did not believe that I would write such a part. But the current iPhone 12Max(Pro) and latest Google Android phones have cameras which are as good as point and shoot digital cameras. It is questionable if people are buying phones any more of if they are infact purchasing a camera! Recently I picked up a iPhone 12MaxPro and I have been extremely excited about the night mode. This offers upto 30s in exposure and uses the onboard AI and staking methods to generate a composite image which I must say I have been very impressed with. Clearly these cameras are advancing, but the quality of the glass used in the lenses and also the ability to interchange lenses is never going to be part of you phone. All things considered if this is the total of your camera collection the night sky is still within your grasp.

##Point and Shoot Cameras
These are everywhere – so many people have a point and shoot camera which has a dial either physical or digital for different modes of operation. Lets be honest this never moves from [AUTO] ! it time to make a change and shift this to different modes and experiment. Although these cameras come with fixed lenses and in general small sensors they are still very capable at night time photography. Of course the images should be better than the smart phone but will not be as good as those from DSLR camera. If this is the only camera you have and it has modes other than Auto i.e. manual and a tripod adaptor (M5 screw thread on base) then were good and follow along. 
##DSLR Cameras

DSLR cameras have the advantage over other forms as they in general allow for interchangeable lens configurations from 
short focal length to large telephoto lens. Ideal cameras for this job are any Nikon D series or Canon EOS camera are 
great to start offering different attributes from full frame sensors meaning that they have the same image size as a 
35mm film camera to the APS-C sized consumer grade DSLR’s and a range of reasonably affordable lenses.
<br/>
There are other types of camera which start to move into the specialist range. Many deep sky photographers use dedicated 
cameras, these days CMOS chip are very prevalent such as those found in consumer DSLR cameras or CCD chips. These cameras 
do not have any of the controls that a DSLR and are to be coupled direct to lenses or telescopes and are in general 
computer controlled. These cameras some in 2 flavours those with sensors that have the RGB colour matrix removed or 
those which still retain this. Of course this means that one is mono and the other can reconstruct colour images direct. 
Mono is much more popular with advanced imaging field as this allows the use of narrow band filters which provide access 
to wavelengths of light which generate spectacular images. 
<br/>
These dedicated cameras also have other filters removed from the surface of the sensor. These are present in all DSLR 
cameras and limit the light which reach the sensor. In general they reduce the level of red wavelengths as well as cut 
ultraviolet light. Some manufacturers have produced modified cameras, Canon first (20Da), Nikon(D810a) and lately the 
Sony Alpha-7a these have enhanced red light detection and are more suitable to astronomy. 
In our case it is highly likely that we will be using a consumer DSLR or point and shoot camera which is a great 
introduction to this form of photography
