# The Equipment used to Generate these images

The Equipment which I use as a day to day workhorses include my ageing William Optics FLT110 and now my William Optics RedCat51

##WO FLT110 Original Optics.
This really is my workhorse -- this is a critical piece of equipment and was an amazing pourchase. As with many scopes i have had issues with the focuser and still do -- it really was teh worse part of this telescope but the Optics......

It really does have good optics held in a sturdy cell which has been mistreated and bounced around. All of the telescopic images are taken with the FLT it is the only scope worth imaging through.


I have 4 Telescopes which are functional. a WO RedCat51, Skywatcher 102 Achromat, Orion ED80 and a WO FLT TMB 110. I also have an UK Orion 10" newtonian but this needs a lot of love and attention 

The telescoeps are mounted on in general a Losmandy G11 with Gemini control and the smaller redcat is on a iOptron EQ30Pro

I use both a Cannon 6D and a sBIG ST8300 camera for imaging as well as having a number of really nice camera full frame lenses
