...and learn at the same time.
# My background.

Completely self taught ! I spend as much time as possible imaging and capturing photons under the night sky. 
I have a modest setup with a reasonable collection of scopes and cameras. 

This is a hoby that i have been trying to get better at for a number of years starting about 25 years ago. 
I have a lot of knowledge about how to setup and how to start running imaging runs but I woudl never asy that I have a comprehensive knowledge!!

I have imaged on 3 continents and enjoyed th enightsky under many more 

## Locations

It is all about Location and there is never a good location under suburban skies !
