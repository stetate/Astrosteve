Daytime photography capitalises upon the functions of digital cameras, rapid autofocus, 
image stabilization, autoexposure. Photography at night is raw and back to basics. 
Almost all camera aids are none functional and its back to manual modes and knowledge of what 
your camera system is capable of. Once mastered the night sky can provide some of the most rich and 
spectacular photographic opportunities. Whether it’s the photography of constellations, 
the milky way, meteor showers, the transit of the International Space station, or the nebulas 
of the summer skies most digital cameras have this capability to different degrees. 
A photographic system can essentially be broken into 3 different parts:

1.	the sensor which detects the light, this of course used to be photographic film
2.	the camera body which supports the sensor and in general has the electronics to control 
      the camera
3.	the lens which focuses the light onto the sensor chip. 

Within the following links we will discuss the different aspects and optimal method to setup for 
      night time photography. Although different camera manufacturers have different terminology 
      for different items of their cameras the language used through these pages will relate to 
      Canon cameras but can be translated to other manufacturers.
